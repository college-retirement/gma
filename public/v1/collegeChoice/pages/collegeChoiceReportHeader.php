When a student begins his or her college search, it is especially important for parents to keep in mind that the results they hope for and what their students expect are two different things. There may be schools on this list that you are not familiar with, but this doesn't mean that they are not worthy of consideration, <i>especially if they can be used to leverage another financial aid award at another college!</i>
<br><br>
The <img src="../images/CollegeChoiceLogoSmall.gif" width="73" height="18"> results will help you and your student make well-informed decisions about which college is the best fit -- both academically and financially. It is intended to help by identifying beforehand which colleges are likely to accept your student and how much aid that school is typically going to offer.  Knowing this prior to applying can put you well ahead of the learning curve.  
<br><br>
While we hope that you will find that perfect college or university which meets your student's academic goals and social needs (as well as your ability to pay) it is important to keep in mind that <img src="../images/CollegeChoiceLogoSmall.gif" width="73" height="18"> is more than just a search tool used to identify colleges that your student would want to attend. This tool is intended to find schools that are searching for students like yours - not the other way around - and the intention of finding these competing schools is that they will potentially offer a better financial package, which can then be used to "leverage" a more highly-desired school.
