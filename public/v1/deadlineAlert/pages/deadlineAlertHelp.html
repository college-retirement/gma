The Deadline Alert system is designed to keep you up to date with the most important<sup>*</sup> college deadlines.
<br><br>
When you log in to the Deadline Alert system, you'll see the following sections:
<ul>
	<li>My Schools</li>
	<li>Add Schools</li>
	<li>Deadline List</li>
</ul>
<br>
In addition to the deadlines you see when you log into the system, you will also receive email alerts about your upcoming deadlines.
<br><br>
<u>My Schools</u>
<br>
The My Schools List shows which schools you have signed up to receive alerts for.  Only deadlines for schools in your My Schools list will appear in your Deadlines List. From the My Schools list, you can click the magnifying glass icon to show only deadlines at that school, or click the red 'X' to delete the school from your list.
<br><br>
<u>Add Schools</u>
<br>
The Add Schools tool will allow you to look up and add colleges to your list.  Simply start typing a college's name and the lookup tool will suggest schools based on what you type.  To add a school to your My Schools list, click its name in the Add Schools suggestion list.
<br><br>
<u>Deadline List</u>
<br>
The Deadline List shows the name, date, and institution of each of your upcoming deadlines.  From this menu, you can mark a deadline complete, or visit the school's web site for more information.  Once a deadline is marked complete, you can clear the date by clicking the "Clear" link.
<br><br><br><br>
*The Deadline Alerts system does not contain an exhaustive list of all deadlines at a particular college or institution. For the most accurate information, consult your school's website or faculty.
