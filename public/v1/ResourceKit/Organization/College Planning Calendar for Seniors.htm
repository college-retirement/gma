                </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Narrow your list of colleges to 5 to 10. Meet with a counselor about them and, if
                        you’ve not yet done so, download college applications and financial aid forms. Plan
                        to visit as many of these colleges as possible.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Create a master list or calendar that includes:
                        <ul>
                        <li>tests you’ll take and their fees, dates, and registration deadlines.</li>
                        <li>college application due dates.</li>
                        <li>financial aid application forms required and their deadlines. (Note: Aid applications
                        may be due before college applications.)</li>
                        <li>other materials you’ll need (recommendations, transcripts, etc.).</li>
                        <li>your high school’s own application processing deadlines.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>If you can’t afford application or test fees, a counselor can help you request a
                        fee waiver.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If you have not had your test scores sent to the college to which you are applying,

                    <li>Try to finalize your college choices.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Prepare Early Decision, Early Action, or rolling admissions applications as soon
                        as possible.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Ask for counselor or teacher recommendations if you need them. Give each teacher
                        or counselor an outline of your academic record and your extracurricular activities.
                        For each recommendation, provide a stamped, addressed envelope, and any college
                        forms required.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If you’re submitting essays, write first drafts and ask teachers and others to read
                        them. If you’re applying for Early Decision, finish the essays for that application
                        now&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If you have not had your test scores sent to the college to which you are applying,

                    <li>November 1—15: For Early Decision admissions, colleges may require test scores and
                        applications between these dates.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Complete at least one college application by Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Counselors send transcripts to colleges. Give counselors the proper forms at least
                        two weeks before colleges require them. </li>

                    <li>If you apply to colleges online, be sure to have your high school send a transcript—it
                        goes to colleges separately, and by mail. </li>

                    <li>Keep active in school. If you are wait-listed, the college will want to know what
                        you have accomplished between the time you applied and learned of its decision.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>You should receive acceptance letters and financial aid offers by mid-April. If
                        you’ve not done so yet, visit your final college before accepting. As soon as you
                        decide, notify your counselor of your choice.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If you have questions about housing offers, talk to your counselor or call the college.

                <ul>
                    <li>May 1: Colleges cannot require a deposit or commitment to attend before May 1. By
                        that postmarked date, you must inform every college of your acceptance or rejection
                        of the offer of admission and/or financial aid. (Questions? Talk to your counselor.)&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Send your deposit to one college only.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Wait-listed by a college? If you will enroll if accepted, tell the admissions director
                        your intent and ask how to strengthen your application. Need financial aid? Ask
                        whether funds will be available if you’re accepted.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Work with a counselor to resolve any admissions or financial aid problems. </li>
