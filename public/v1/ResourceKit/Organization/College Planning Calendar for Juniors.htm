                <strong>Fall </strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                Start with you: Make lists of your abilities, social/cultural preferences, and personal
                qualities. List things you may want to study and do in college.
                <br />
                <br />
                Learn about colleges. Look at their Web sites (<a href="http://www.collegeboard.com"
                    target="_blank">www.collegeboard.com</a> has links). Talk to friends, family,
                teachers, and recent grads of your school now in college. List college features
                that interest you.
                <br />
                <br />
                Resource check: Visit the counseling office and meet the counselors there. Is there
                a college night for students and families? When will college representatives visit
                your school? (Put the dates in your calendar) Examine catalogs and guides.
                <br />
                <br />
                At school, sign up early to take the PSAT/NMSQT®, which is given in October. If
                you plan to ask for testing accommodations (because of a disability), be sure your
                eligibility is approved by the College Board. Check with your school counselor.
                <br />
                <br />
                Make a file to manage your college search, testing, and application data.
                <br />
                If appropriate (for example, if you’re interested in drama, music, art, sports,
                etc.), start to gather material for a portfolio.
                <br />
                <br />
                With your family, start to learn about financial aid. Read the Department of Education’s
                Funding Your Education (about federal aid programs). Use Getting Financial Aid published
                by the College Board and the financial aid calculator at <a href="http://apps.collegeboard.com/fincalc/efc_welcome.jsp"
                    target="_blank">www.collegeboard.com</a> to estimate how much aid you might
                receive.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Winter
                    <br />
                </strong>
                <br />
                Make a family appointment with your counselor to discuss ways to improve your college-
                preparation and selection processes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sign up to take the SAT® and/or ACT at least once in the spring and again next fall.
                Register online or through your school. Fee waivers are available for students with
                financial need. To prepare, download practice booklets from <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about.html"
                    target="_blank">www.collegeboard.com</a> (for the SAT) or from <a href="http://www.act.org"
                        target="_blank">www.act.org</a> (for ACT).
                <br />
                <br />
                Begin a search for financial aid sources. National sources include the College Board
                Scholarship Handbook and electronic sources. Don’t overlook local and state aid
                sources (ask a counselor or check your public library).
                <br />
                <br />
                Ask a counselor or teacher about taking the SAT Subject Tests” in the spring. You
                should take them while course material is still fresh in your mind. You can download
                “Taking the SAT Subject Tests;’ which offers test-prep advice, from <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about.html"
                    target="_blank">www.collegeboard.com</a>.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you’re in Advanced Placement Program® (AP®) classes, register for AP Exams, given
                in May. You can earn college credit for courses not given in the AP Program by taking
                CLEP® tests at a college test center See <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about.html" target="_blank">
                    www.collegeboard.com</a> to learn more.

                <strong>Spring
                    <br />
                </strong>
                <br />
                Visit some local colleges—large, small, public, and private. Get a feel for what
                works for you. Attend college fairs, too.
                <br />
                <br />
                Scan local newspapers to see which civic, cultural, and service organizations in
                your area award financial aid to graduating seniors. Start a file.
                <br />
                <br />
                Develop a list of 15 or 20 colleges that attract you. Request viewbooks and information
                about financial aid and academic programs that interest you. Visit some colleges
                over your, spring break.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you are considering military academies or ROTC scholarships, contact your counselor
                before leaving school for the summer. If you want a four-year ROTC scholarship,
                you should begin the application process the summer before your senior year.

                If you are an athlete planning to continue playing a sport in college, register
                with the NCAA Clearinghouse (<a href="http://www.ncaaclearinghouse.net" target="_blank">www.ncaaclearinghouse.net</a>).
                <br />
                <br />
                Find a full-time or part-time job, or participate in a camp or summer college program.
                <br />
                Visit colleges. Take campus tours and, at colleges you’re serious about, make appointments
                to have interviews with admissions counselors.
                <br />
                <br />
                Create a résumé—a record of accomplishments, activities, and work experiences since
                you started high school.
                <br />
                <br />
                Download applications (or request paper copies) from colleges to which you’ll apply.
                Check application dates—large universities may have early dates or rolling admissions.
