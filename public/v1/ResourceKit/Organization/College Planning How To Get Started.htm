                <strong>Get started.<br />
                </strong>Assess your strengths, weaknesses, goals, passions, learning style, social
                skills. What is most important to you in the college-search process? What do you
                hope to gain from the process?
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Make some basic decisions.</strong><br />
                Where do you want to live? Will you go to college full-time? Or part-time? Do you
                want to attend a single-sex school, a technical college, a public or private college,
                a large university, a small liberal arts college, a historically black or religiously
                affiliated college? How important to you is the cultural/ideological diversity of
                the student body?
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Enlist help.</strong><br />
                Who do you want to assist you in this process (parents, teachers, siblings, relatives,
                friends)?<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Consult references.</strong><br />
                Look at college directories (College Board College Handbook, Barron’s, Peterson’s
                and Princeton Review) and use college searches (<a href="http://www.collegeboard.com"
                    target="_blank">www.collegeboard.com</a>).<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Talk with your teachers and your school counselor about your dreams and goals.</strong><br />
                Discuss your plans with your parents. Ask for their advice.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Meet with college representatives when they visit the school.</strong><br />
                The guidance office will post information on upcoming visits. Have questions ready.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Visit campuses every chance you get.</strong><br />
                Take a tour, meet with an admissions representative, ask students what they think
                of the college.<br />
