                It may seem early to start thinking about getting your child ready for college,
                but it really isn’t— important groundwork should take place in ninth and tenth grade.
                Here’s a list to help you make sure your child is on the right track:
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Grade 9
                    <br />
                </strong>
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Create a four-year high school plan</strong>. Once your child is settled into ninth grade,
                        introduce the idea of preparing an overall plan for high school that relates to
                        his or her goals.
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Make sure you and your child know what high school courses are required by colleges
                        and that your child’s ninth-grade courses are on the right track.
                        </li><li>
                        Map out when these courses should be taken.
                        </li><li>
                        Familiarize yourself with the various levels of courses offered by your child’s
                        school.<br /></li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Start your child thinking about careers</strong>. Encourage your child to develop a tentative
                        career goal. Of course it will change—often—but it’s the thought process that counts.
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Help your child to identify interests—likes and dislikes—not just in academics
                        but in all areas. This will help your child focus on goals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Encourage your child to discuss career options with others, such as the school                        
                        counselor, teachers, recent college graduates who are working, professionals in
                        the community, etc.<br />
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Suggest extracurricular activities</strong>. Encourage your child to actively take part in
                        a sport, school club, music or drama group, or community volunteer activity.
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Remember that colleges would rather see real involvement in one activity than
                        a loose connection to several activities.
                        </li><li>
                        If your child may want to play sports in college, research the National College
                        Athletic Association eligibility requirements. The NCAA requires completion of certain
                        core courses; you can find the specifics at www.ncaaclearinghouse.net.<br />
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Meet with the school counselor</strong>. The school counselor knows how to help your child
                        get the most out of high school. Make sure your child has an opportunity during
                        the school year to discuss post—high school plans with the school counselor.
                        <ul><li>
                        You should participate in this meeting, too.<br /></li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Save for college</strong>. It’s still not too late to start a college savings plan, if you
                        haven’t already. Every little bit helps!
                        <ul><li>
                        Investigate state financial aid programs and 529 plans.<br />
                        </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Obtain a social security number for your child if you don’t already have one</strong>. This
                        is often required for applications, testing, scholarships, and other opportunities.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>Grade 10 </strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Meet with the school counselor—again</strong>. Make sure your child meets with his or her
                        school counselor to ensure that he or she is enrolled in college-preparatory courses.
                        <ul><li>
                        Check to see that your child is taking any prerequisites to advanced-level junior-
                        and senior-year courses.<br />
                        </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Ask if the PSAT/NMSQT® if offered to tenth-graders</strong>. While this test is usually taken
                        in the eleventh grade, it is also often offered in the tenth. That’s because it
                        provides invaluable feedback on the Student Score Report; tenth-graders can then
                        work on any disclosed academic weaknesses while there is still ample time to improve
                        them.&nbsp;<br />
                    </li><li><strong>Is your child interested in attending a U.S. military academy?</strong> If so, he or she
                        should request a pre-candidate questionnaire and complete it.&nbsp;<br />
                        </li><li><strong>Attend college and career fairs</strong>. These often take place in the fall, at your school,
                        or in your area.&nbsp;<br />
        </li><li><strong>Support your child’s participation in a school activity or volunteer effort.
                        <br />
                    </strong>
                        Extracurricular activities help students develop time-management skills and enrich
                        the school experience.&nbsp;<br />
                        </li><li><strong>Tour college campuses</strong>. If possible, take advantage of vacation or other family travel
                        opportunities to visit colleges and see what they’re like.
                        <ul><li>
                        a. Even if there is no interest in attending the college you are visiting, it will
                        help your child learn what to look for in a college. </li></ul>
