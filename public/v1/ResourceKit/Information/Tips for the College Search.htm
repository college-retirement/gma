                <strong>Pressure Points</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Since going to college is a major life event (and there aren’t that many for most
                of us), sitting down with your completed questionnaires should be a special occasion.
                Schedule a time in advance. Make sure that other pressing obligations (and younger
                siblings) are out of the way. Consider heading to a quiet restaurant or to a favorite
                secluded spot. This will underscore the importance of the meeting and often make
                it possible to discuss conflicts clearly and calmly.
                </p>
                <p>
                Emphasize the positive aspects of the process—your mutual hopes and dreams, the
                excitement of a wide range of opportunities and options. Remember that you are sharing
                an experience that is the culmination of many years of schooling and parenting,
                and that no decisions need to be made overnight; no disagreements have to be resolved
                instantly; and compromise” may be an important watchword along the way.

                For example, Chelsea’s parents envisioned her at a small, rural Catholic women’s
                college. She was sold on Boston University—large, urban, and certainly coed. She
                agreed to investigate both and, in doing so, discovered Wellesley, which became
                her first choice and pleased everyone.

                Of course not all stories have such happy endings, but there are some other points
                for parents to keep in mind that will ease tensions and help to precipitate a fruitful
                and usually peaceful college search.

                <strong>Are you able to let go?</strong>

                <p>
                What fears do you have about how family life will change when your child leaves
                for college? Will there be a family left at all? Are you anxious about how to fill
                the time you once devoted to this child?

                Letting Go: A Parents’ Guide to Today’s College Experience, by Karen Levin Coburn
                and Madge Lawrence Treeger, and Don’t Tell Me What to Do, Just Send Money: The Essential
                Parenting Guide to the College Years, by Helen E. Johnson and Christine Schelhas-Miller,
                are two books that offer insight and advice to parents dealing with the emotional
                side of sending a child to college.

                <strong>Whose idea is this, anyway?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Try to keep your own goals or needs separate from what your child wants.
                It’s tough. Eighteen year-olds don’t always know what’s best for them. They may
                choose to study archaeology, astronomy, French, or fashion design only because that’s
                what a friend is doing. Meanwhile, you worry that history majors end up waiting
                tables; that art school graduates sweep floors.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ask your child to explain choices and try to point out when plans seem outrageous,
                but never deny a dream just because it’s not your dream. Some parents live vicariously
                through their children, just as some children live for their parents’ approval.
                Each of you must learn to recognize whose voice you’re really hearing.
