           <b><center>Don't start school without these useful—and fun—gadgets!</b></center> 
<br />
You’re probably already familiar with your college’s specific computer requirements. So armed with these details, tap into our list of must-have tech gear before you head off to your freshman year. 
<br />
            <br />
While you’re at it, encourage your oh-so-generous friends and relatives to view your wish list, too. Make it easy for them by leaving your list in prominent areas—who knows, you might end up with something useful, like a digital recorder or a Flash drive, instead of a chintzy gold penholder or monogrammed handkerchief. (Sorry, Grandma!) 
<br />
            <br />
<b>Your Computing Core: Desktop or Laptop?</b>
<br />
Desktop versus laptop: No contest here. The laptop wins hands down. Flexibility, portability, dainty size—and you can find featherweight units, as well. 
<br />
            <br />
Our advice: Buy as much computer as you can afford, but be realistic. If you’re a language major, for instance, and you’ll mainly be writing papers and using the Internet to do research, a starter system will fit the bill just fine. On the other hand, you engineers and architecture majors will need more computing oomph to grapple with power-hungry programs like AutoCAD. Select the fastest chip, the most memory, and the best graphics card that your cash stash can handle. 
<br />
            <br />
If you’re opting for a PC, don’t assume that Windows Vista is the required operating system. Your department may have decided not to support it, so you might have to stick with XP. Double-check your school’s specs list before you make the wrong move.
<br />
            <br />
One more tip: You’ll love being able to lug your laptop from your cramped dorm room to the library or your favorite coffee house. But if you’re inclined to step away from your notebook to get one triple latte after another, don’t tempt fate: Invest in a physical lock or an alarm or even LoJack for your laptop. 
<br />
            <br />
<b>Hard (and Fast) Copies: Printer
</b><br />As far as submitting papers goes, more and more departments—and professors—are going 100 percent electronic. That said, a printer is awfully handy for printouts of your homework, term papers, online information, and directions to those study groups you’ll be attending during spring break. 
<br />
            <br />
So invest in a printer—and think about spending a few extra bucks for one that will last you a few years. You’ve got choices: inkjet, laser, multifunction, snapshot (or photo), and mobile. List the primary reasons you’ll need a printer, and as a reference point, check out print samples in stores, if possible. (But keep in mind that the manufacturers create these samples under optimum conditions; your prints may never look as slick.) 
<br />
            <br />
Inkjets are generally the most affordable. They do a decent job handling text, images, and photos. Laser printers deliver super-crisp text and visuals. Snapshot printers, as their name suggests, focus on photo prints. And depending on the model you buy, you could save on printing costs—handy if you’re studying photography or art. 
<br />
            <br />
Multipurpose printers, which come in inkjet and laser flavors, typically handle printing, scanning, copying, and faxing. Some of them do a dandy job of printing photos, too. Mobile printers, given their portable design, will take up less space on your desk, which can be a big plus in a tight dorm room.
<br />
            <br />
Factor into your budget extra costs such as paper, photo paper, and cartridge replacements. Naturally, printer manufacturers recommend you buy their brand-name inks and papers, but you may be attracted to the lower prices offered by third parties for refill kits, ink and toner cartridge replacements. Be wary—risks include inferior print quality and even printer damage. If you plan to print photos, are concerned about reliability, or want your prints to last longer, stick with the printer maker’s own consumables. And watch out for ultra-cheapo printers—before you know it, you could spend more on cartridge replacements than the actual printer.
<br />
            <br />
<b>Music To Your Ears: Audio Player and Speakers
</b><br />You already know that it’s an iPod world out there. Shuffle, Nano, Touch, and Classic: which one is for you? 
<br />
            <br />
Some pointers: The Shuffle is teeny, weighs about half an ounce, and it’s easy to carry or clip on. But you’re limited in the amount of music you can tote (up to 500 tracks); furthermore, it lacks a display. The Nano still lets you keep things small—it weighs less than two ounces—plus, it has a 2-inch display and offers greater capacity (up to 2,000 tracks). The Touch comes with the iPhone-like touchy-feely screen, a 3.5-inch display, a Web browser, built-in wireless, and you can cart around up to 7,000 tracks. The Classic iPods are the heaviest of the lot, weighing in at almost 6 ounces, and you can carry up to a ridiculous 40,000 tracks. Shuffle aside, these iPods also support video and photos.
<br />
            <br />
Want to escape the invasion of the iPod people? Other players worth a listen include the Microsoft Zune, Creative Zen, iRiver, Sony, Samsung, and Archos. 
<br />
            <br />
Lastly, consider giving your ear canals a break now and then by buying a speaker system. You’ll find computer speakers and iPod speakers from Altec Lansing, Apple, Bose, Bowers & Wilkins, Chestnut Hill, Harmon Kardon, Klipsch, and Logitech. Visualize your dorm room as you shop—think small, think portable—and don’t forget the possibility that your roommate-to-be might not share your musical tastes!
<br />
            <br />
<b>Picture Perfect: Digital Camera
</b><br />“You never call us.” “What were you up to over the weekend?” “Are you eating properly?” “Remember, you’re still underage!” 
<br />
            <br />
Want to appease your worried ‘rents? Make the most of your digital camera! You’re online anyway, so whisk off lots of reassuring shots to keep them off your back: you or your roommate at your desks, piles of books spilling open, an apple, banana, and peeled carrots neatly placed beside a glass of milk…. You get the idea. (If your intended recipients don’t have a computer, use an online service like Shutterfly or Picasa to order prints.)
<br />
            <br />
Point-and-shoot cameras, even manufacturers’ entry-level models, are a great choice for casual photographers. Before you go shopping, decide what features matter most to you: camera weight and size, resolution, digital zoom, storage medium, LCD screen size, and battery type (a proprietary rechargeable one or a couple of disposable AAs, say?). The ultra-compact units are super-easy to pop in your shirt pocket, but alas, they can be super-easy to drop or lose, too.
<br />
            <br />
If you’re a more serious shooter, you’ll need to invest in a more sophisticated camera, an SLR (single-lens reflex) most likely. These are bulkier, more expensive, and more cumbersome to lug around. But you get much more control over the features—and you can have fun with interchangeable lenses to boot!
<br />
            <br />
Want more ideas to complement your digicam vibe? Here are six: an LCD screen protector, a backup battery of the proprietary kind, a well-padded carrying case, a tripod, additional memory cards—and wads of high-quality photo paper for your printer. 
<br />
            <br />
<b>Always on Call: Cell Phone
</b><br />Chances are you already have a cell phone—but if your contract is up for renewal, ask yourself these questions (and discuss your answers with the person who pays the bill, if it isn’t you): How old is your phone? Are you happy with it? Is it time for a new handset? Does your allotment of monthly minutes need to be upped dramatically for life on campus? 
<br />
            <br />
As you do your research, make sure any potential carrier offers dependable coverage in your new location. Ask specifically about your campus: If you rattle off your school’s physical address, the company should provide you with their verdict of the service quality in that vicinity. Of course, don’t take their word for it. Ask around and find out how the coverage actually is—coverage can vary in a given location from carrier to carrier. If you can, find out what reception is like in your dorm building. 
<br />
            <br />
As you choose a handset, focus on the features you need most, and avoid paying more for a sexy extra that overlaps with another gadget you own. For example, if you just got a hot new digital camera, why fork out more dough for the phone with the fanciest built-in camera? 
<br />
            <br />
Conversely, if you’d rather not schlep multiple toys across town and you’d prefer to clutch just one device—with a phenomenal user interface and multitouch capabilities—yup, there’s always the iPhone. 
<br />
            <br />
<b>Talking Heads: Video Conferencing Gear
</b><br />Another way to reassure your anxious parents (see Digital Camera) is to chat with them over the Internet on a video call. 
<br />
            <br />
To do this, you’ll need to hook up a Webcam and sign up for a service such as Skype or SightSpeed (or use iChat, already on your Mac). Your family and friends need to have a camera and software installed on their end so you can all see and hear each other. Most services also let you call a landline or cell phone number at reasonable domestic and international rates. 
<br />
            <br />
All new Apple laptops sport a built-in camera, and some PC companies, including Dell, Sony, and Toshiba, make notebooks with built-in cameras, too. Otherwise, buy a Webcam. If you own a laptop, go for a notebook-oriented unit, which will attach nicely to your laptop. If you’re an IM fanatic and live in AIM or Trillian, for instance, try these applications’ video call capabilities. 
<br />
            <br />
You can also use your Webcam to take digital stills, record videos, handle live streaming to the Internet, send video email messages, and even monitor a remote location, such as your off-campus biology experiment.
<br />
            <br />
<b>Electronic Taping: Digital Voice Recorder
</b><br />Sorry to break it to you, but you’ve got hours and hours of lectures to look forward to. Given this reality, you might want to consider getting a voice recorder to record your lectures. Digital recorders make it easy to transfer audio clips to your computer for access and playback later. You can also arrange your clips into folders on the device itself. 
<br />
            <br />
Olympus and Sony are good places to start. As you peruse different devices, think about features that would come in handy: you might need voice editing software, for example, or the capability to store documents, or a mechanism to slow down playback, which would facilitate transcribing the sentences of fast (or unintelligible) talkers. Some recorders will do a better job than others of capturing your professor’s sweet nothings in an auditorium-like setting. Decide if you want a unit with built-in storage or removable media. 
<br />
            <br />
(Before your fire up your recorder, it’s worth asking if you’ll need permission to record the lecture. In your school, it might be up to each individual lecturer.)
<br />
            <br />
<b>Your Files to Go: Flash Drives
</b><br />As a college student, you’ll have lots of files a-flowing, from papers to music files. It’s always smart to have important files in more than one place. 
<br />
            <br />
USB flash drives are super for storage and portability. These removable devices are compact and operate in a true plug-and-play fashion: Pop your flash drive into a USB port, drag and drop your files into this external device (or grab ones off it), detach the drive when you’re done, and off you go!
<br />
            <br />
If you want more than straight-up storage, some SanDisk drives come with a complementary online backup service (in case you lose your drive). Other SanDisk products let you carry U3-compliant programs—a standard for portable applications—such as Skype, Firefox, and RoboForm. 
<br />
            <br />
Don’t skip this category: One or two flash drives will be the perfect addition to your ever-growing family of tech toys.
