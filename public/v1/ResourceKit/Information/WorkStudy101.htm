            To work or not to work—that is the question. . .
            <br /><br />
Relax, this isn’t your Brit lit class—although you can feel free to take notes. After all, going to college—and deciding if you can squeeze a part-time job into your schedule once you’re there—can be confusing. Knowing your employment options is the first step to finding a job that will suit your schedule and boost your bank account.
<br /><br />
One type of job available to you is federal work-study. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 46% of undergraduate students received federal financial aid in 2003-2004. Work-study is part of such packages. These positions allow you to work 5-10 hours a week in jobs that range from serving food in the cafeteria to doing clerical work to giving campus tours. Pay for work-study jobs is usually around minimum wage, and methods for applying vary from school to school.
<br /><br />
“Get there early when you’re applying for work-study,” says Chris Coons, director of admissions at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa. “The jobs fill up fast.”
<br /><br />
However, if you wish to spread your wings, off-campus employment is a popular choice. Ken Huus, dean of admissions at Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Virginia, says that retail jobs are the most typical off-campus positions. It isn’t hard to see why: pay is usually similar or slightly higher than work-study jobs, and more hours may be available.
<br /><br />
<b>So what should you choose—on-campus employment or off? 
</b><br />According to Michael Gentile, a senior at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, New Hampshire, there are pros and cons to both. Gentile has worked both on and off campus and says the most important thing to consider when job-hunting is flexibility. When it comes to this, work-study can’t be beat: not only is your work schedule built around your classes, but bosses are usually understanding if you have to call in because you have a term paper or an exam. Plus, you never have to leave campus.
<br /><br />
“With a work-study job, you can get up and walk to work,” says Gentile, who now works at Abercrombie & Fitch. “I miss that convenience.”
<br /><br />
According to Coons, work-study is also especially important for freshmen, as these jobs help students get to know people on campus quicker. Huus adds that work-study jobs are great preparation for life after college. For example, some schools include your work on your transcripts, which can be a useful part of your student record when applying for jobs after graduation. Plus, there’s the additional benefit of building a relationship with your boss, who may be helpful later as a job reference or career advisor.
<br /><br />
“The fact that [students] are involved in campus life and have mentors readily available is an invaluable experience,” says Huus.
<br /><br />
There are some limits with work-study, though. Because these jobs are awarded as part of a financial aid package, you have a certain amount of money you can earn in a given year. If you exceed your award, you won’t be paid the overage.
<br /><br />
There is much to consider with off-campus jobs as well. For one thing, you can’t do your homework on-site or call in because you have a group project. While Gentile points out that this has exposed him to valuable, “real-world responsibilities,” he also says it occasionally causes his academics to suffer. On the other hand, off-campus positions sometimes have an opportunity for advancement that may not exist with most work-study jobs. This summer, for example, Gentile was promoted to stock room manager at his store. “It’s nice because my hard work has paid off,” he says. “My managers appreciate my efforts.”
<br /><br />
Either way, though—work-study or non-work-study—employment is an important piece of the college experience: “Having a job is a valuable component because it teaches students to manage their time,” says Coons. Gentile agrees. “Working has taught me a lot,” he says. “On or off campus, it’s definitely the way to go.”
