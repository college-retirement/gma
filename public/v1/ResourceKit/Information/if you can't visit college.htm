<b>            Simply put, reading about a college or visiting a website isn’t nearly as helpful as visiting the campus. However, it may be impossible—because of distance or cost or family obligations—to visit some or all of the colleges you’re interested in. 
</b>
<br />
            <br />
If this is the case with you, there are ways to create for yourself many of the elements of an actual campus visit. 
<br />
            <br />
First and most important, talk to current students and/or very recent alumni of the colleges you’re considering—in person, if possible, rather than online or on the phone. College admission personnel can give you the names of recent graduates and current students from your area. Also, ask your high school counselor or if any grads from your own high school are attending the colleges you’re considering. Contact them and arrange to meet next time they come home. 
<br />
            <br />
When you talk to former or current students, remember that each will have a different point of view, a different value system, and a different area of interest. Combine the various perspectives of the people you speak to and try to get a feel for life on campus. Here are some questions you might consider asking: Is it easy to make friends and get involved in campus life? How many hours a day/week do students study? How much time is there for sports and other activities outside of class? What are the dorms like? How’s the food? What bands performed there last semester? Do students need a car on campus? Are professors easily approachable or aloof? What kind of computer and other tech supplies are required? 
<br />
            <br />
Second, ask the admission office for a DVD, CD, or video that can give you a good feel for the campus. Be sure to visit the college’s website, where you almost certainly can take a virtual tour of the campus. 
<br />
            <br />
Third, ask your high school counselor and your teachers if they have visited the campus. Most counselors have visited lots of campuses and can be in a good position to judge the “fit.” Why? Because your counselor knows both you and the college and can assess how well the college fits your academic interests and skills. 
<br />
            <br />
Fourth, find out if a representative of the college is planning a visit to your school or your area. It will be worth driving a couple of hours, if necessary, to hear a college representative speak, since you’ll get your questions answered and other students may bring up subjects that spark discussion as well. 
<br />
            <br />
Finally, if cost is the issue, ask if the colleges you’re considering help sponsor group or solo visits—some do! 
<br />
            <br />
Your chances of admission won’t necessarily be reduced if you can’t visit a college you’re considering, and—as indicated above—there are lots of ways to get the “feel” of a college or university without actually being there.
