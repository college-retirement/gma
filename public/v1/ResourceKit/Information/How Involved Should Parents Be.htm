                        the student. In reality, it is usually the parent. </li>

                    You may already have been terrified by tales of parents who seem to make their kid’s
                    college admission a full-time occupation. One private school college counselor remembers
                    such a mother who created a personal scrapbook for her son, had it professionally
                    typeset and printed, hired a writer to compose the essays, and had a secretary fill
                    out all the applications. After submitting the completed packages to her son for
                    his signature, she Fed Ex-ed the whole shebang to each college.”
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    At the other end of the spectrum—but by no means alone—is the Brown alumna who recalls
                    that her mother refused to take any part in the application process. “She sent me
                    off on bus and train trips around the country to visit colleges by myself. In retrospect,
                    I suppose it wasn’t such a bad thing. It helped make me independent. But every time
                    an admission interviewer asked me, ‘Are you here today with someone who may have
                    questions?’ then it hurt.”
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As a parent, it is critically important that you don’t become too involved in the
                    selection and application process. After all, you are not the one who is going to
                    college, and children should always feel that they have played a key part in this
                    important decision about their lives. Since most will soon be living far enough
                    away that you won’t be there to constantly remind them about daily responsibilities,
                    this is also a good time to make certain that they’re ready to take the reins. Yet,
                    don’t go too much the other way and not give enough support—moral, financial, and
                    even clerical—needed during this sometimes frustrating, always busy period. You
                    should find the best balance between being overbearing and nagging and being apathetic
                    and distant.

                    Colleges, by the way, don’t give extra credit for parental involvement— nor for
                    students who survive without it. Contrary to what the grapevine tells you, it doesn’t
                    matter who calls to request catalogues or directions, nor how many parents (or sets
                    of parents) are downstairs in the waiting room during an interview. Admission officers
                    only wince when it’s clear that candidates are passing off Mom or Dad’s efforts
                    as their own, like the prepackaged prospect described above or the applicant who
                    can barely speak English but submits an essay that sounds suspiciously like Self-Reliance.

                        <br />
                    </strong></span>
                    <br />
                    In only the past few decades, the college admission process has become a highly
                    charged, often tense and disruptive experience for many families. Where does all
                    this pressure come from?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For starters, it comes from colleges themselves. Student recruiting is now a top
                    priority. Schools print more publications and send them out sooner than ever before.
                    They vie for hot prospects by offering free flights and campus weekends, complete
                    with tickets to concerts and sporting events. Exacting application requirements,
                    endless forms, essays, and deadlines all add to the stress.</li>
                    <li>Likewise, it comes from society. We live in a designer culture, where name-brand
                    cars, clothes, luggage—and colleges—assure us (and others) that we’ve “made it.”
                    The media, too, is relentless in reminding us of the importance of approaching college
                    in the proper way, and of the capriciousness of admission decisions, even when we
                    do. Stores are brimming with books aimed at enlightening us about the most arcane
                    aspects of the process, while burgeoning businesses prey on fears of substandard
                    test scores.</li>
                    <li>Students, of course, put pressure on themselves. Where you live, where your child
                    goes to school, and even the varying personalities that make one senior class different
                    than the next will all determine how college admission affects your family.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Finally, the really big-time pressure can come from parents. The current generation
                    of upcoming college students is the first with a high percentage of parents who
                    have attended college themselves. Those who went to renowned and prestigious places
                    usually expect their children to do as well. Those from less-celebrated schools
                    often demand that their children do better. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Moreover, with college costs skyrocketing, parents have become savvy and careful
                    consumers. They consider a college education an investment and expect immense returns.
                    They scrutinize schools more critically than their own parents ever did and have
                    more specific questions—and demands-that can also mean more stress at home.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Family life, as well, is not always as simple as it was when Ward and Wally Cleaver
                    conferred in the study, while June baked brownies for the Beaver. Today, some students
                    have one parent; some have more than four. Many have two who barely speak, or who
                    use the college application process as a weapon in their own power struggle.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>THE GOOD AND THE BAD NEWS:</em></strong> Both the strengths and weaknesses of parent/child relationships
                    (and parent/parent relationships) will be amplified during the college search. </li>
                </ul>

                    Use these self-assessment surveys to help you and your child as you
                    approach the college selection experience.

                <ul>
                    <li>To get the whole process up and running; to generate discussions; to foster awareness
                    of some of the complex questions and issues that are part of college decision-making&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>To recognize potential hot spots, where you and your child (or you and your spouse,
                    or all of you) are likely to disagree, so that problems can be diffused before they
                    really heat up&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>To create pleasant surprises—those areas where you thought you d disagree, but
                    don’t&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>To pinpoint priorities that all of you will want to consider and start identifying
                    “target schools” (So don’t throw away your questionnaires.) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong><em>

                    Actually, there aren’t many. There are two separate but similar tests: one for parents;
                    one for kids. If your child is just starting high school, answer what you can, then
                    retake the quiz in a year or so to see what’s changed. Even parents of seniors who
                    do the survey now and again in a few months may be amazed by the differences. A
                    sociologist-to-be in September could be considering medicine by March.

                    <br />
                    Don’t hesitate to add comments, as needed, or to make up your own responses if the
                    multiple-choice options aren’t multiple enough. When everyone has finished the quiz,
                    call a meeting to talk about your answers, but respect the others’ privacy. There
                    may be some thoughts that each of you would rather keep confidential.
