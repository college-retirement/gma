            You finally sent out that last college application. Just when you thought you couldn't stand one more minute of stress and anxiety, you can suddenly breathe again. As the waiting game begins, at least you know that you've taken every step possible to send out thoughtful and complete application packets. Then, without warning, all that stress and anxiety comes rushing back; schools start sending you letters indicating that parts of your applications are missing. "Impossible," you think, but nagging doubts emerge. Before you panic, though, read on to find out why this occurrence is common and how you can cope with the tension it brings.

<b>Why Colleges Often Report Missing Application Material
</b><br />Colleges are inundated by the volumes of mail they receive. One large public university reports that it generally takes in more than 100,000 pieces of information from freshman applicants alone. Another states that 30 U.S. mail tubs full of applications arrive at deadline time, and numerous schools say that they receive more than half their applications right at the deadline. In addition, now that many schools require that admissions test scores be sent directly from the testing agency and letters of recommendation come from a variety of sources, colleges and universities no longer obtain complete applications in a single envelope.
<br /><br />
Logistically speaking, opening, dating, sorting, and processing applications can be burdensome. Even with armies of workers on hand, the length of the entire operation can take anywhere from four days to three weeks, depending on the size of the school. Quite reasonably, then, there will be a delay between the arrival of an application at an admissions office and the placement of all information into an individual's file. "Missing" material is generally somewhere in the admissions office and has yet to be filed. Letters, quite simply, are sent to applicants as a sort of insurance. So stay calm!
<br /><br />
Other factors also come into play. Letters and packages handled by the U.S. Postal Service are often referred to as snail mail and with good reason. In the current age of faxing, emailing, and instant messaging, people are used to immediate communication. Sending information by post takes time. When you mail your college application, remember that there will be a lag between when you send it and when it is received. Missing information is sometimes en route.
<br /><br />
Of course, more and more students are choosing to apply to schools online. With online applications, the problems of paper volume and snail mail are seemingly solved, but a new issue has emerged. Some applicants don't trust the online application process, so after they send their information electronically, they mail it and sometimes fax it as well. Obviously, this creates double or triple the amount of work for the admissions office staff, and the sorting process takes even longer. So pick one form of application and stick to it.
<br /><br />
<b>How to Ensure Your Applications Reach Their Destinations
</b><br />It is common for students and parents to feel tension during the college application process. Sending out applications, however, doesn't have to be an activity that causes stress. Following these steps will ensure that your applications get to where they're going:
<br /><br />
<b>Send applications in a timely manner.</b> Getting college applications in on time actually means sending them out several weeks in advance of the school's deadline. This will allow the post office to deliver the material and the staff in the admissions office to process it with time to spare. Even if you're emailing your applications, send them in advance just in case any unforeseen issues come up. When you mail your applications in advance of deadlines, even if material needs to be resent, there's nothing to worry about.
<br /><br />
<b>Keep a copy of everything.</b> Make sure to duplicate your entire application. Also, remember to hang on to notes or emails from admissions offices, personal identification numbers and passwords, and even canceled checks. It never hurts to have full documentation of your actions and interactions, especially if a problem crops up later.
<br /><br />
<b>Send self-addressed postcards.</b> Some high schools include return notes with application materials so that colleges and universities can reply and acknowledge that information has been received. If your high school sends this type of response card, great. If not, invest in some stamps and postcards so you can send a response card to colleges on your own. This extra step can give you the peace of mind you crave.
<br /><br />
<b>Keep your name consistent. </b>Choose one name and stick with it. If you include your middle name on one document, you must remember to use it on all other forms. If you have a nickname, decide whether you will apply using that name or your given name. Either way, don't switch once you've chosen because the likelihood of mix-ups and missing pieces will undoubtedly increase if you do.
<b><br /><br />
Get the facts. </b>Even if part of your application really is missing, the situation is easily fixed. Avoid angry confrontations with admissions officers or your school counselors. Take a deep breath; find out the real deal by calling the college's admissions office; and then take the steps necessary, if any, to rectify the situation.
