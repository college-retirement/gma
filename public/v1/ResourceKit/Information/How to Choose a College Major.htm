        The most important piece of advice in this article follows this sentence, so please make note of it 
        and repeat it to yourself as often as you need as you read this article and make decisions regarding 
        choosing a major in college. Are you ready for it? The advice: <strong>Don't panic.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        I know it's easier said than done, but I can't tell you how many students I have advised since the 
        time that I have been a professor that seem in a state of panic if they are uncertain of their major, 
        let alone a career. Choosing a major, thinking about a career, getting an education -– these are the 
        things college is all about. Yes, there are some students who arrive on campus and know exactly their 
        major and career ambitions, but the majority of students do not, thus there is no need to rush into a 
        decision about your major as soon as you step on campus. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        And guess what? A majority of students in all colleges and universities change their major at least 
        once in their college careers; and many change their major several times over the course of their 
        college career.&nbsp; 
        </li>
        <li>
        This article is all about giving you some pointers and direction -- some steps for you to take -- 
        in your journey toward discovering that ideal career path for you. But it is a journey, so make sure 
        you spend some time thinking about it before making a decision. And don't be discouraged if you still 
        don't have a major the first time you take this journey...your goal should be narrowing your focus from 
        all possible majors to a few areas that you can then explore in greater depth.&nbsp;</li>
        <li> 
        Please also keep in mind that many schools have double majors, some triple majors, and most minors as 
        well as majors. Way back when I was an undergraduate at Syracuse University, I was a dual major in 
        marketing and magazine journalism. Today I am a college professor and Webmaster of a top career 
        resources Website...which brings me to the last piece of general advice before you begin your journey: 
        your major in college is important for your first job after graduation, but studies show that most 
        people will change careers -- yes, careers -- about four or five times over the course of their lives -– 
        and no major exists that can prepare you for that! &nbsp;</li> 
        <li>
        The <strong>first</strong> stop on your journey should be an examination or self-assessment of your interests. What types 
        of things excite you? What types of jobs or careers appeal to you?  There are many self-assessment tools 
        available for free on the web that will help you get started. Also, many, if not all, college career centers 
        have a variety of self-tests you can take to help you answer some of these questions. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        The <strong>second</strong> stop on your journey is an examination of your abilities. What are your strengths? What are 
        your weaknesses? What kind of skills do you have? You can begin this self-examination by looking at the 
        courses you took in high school. What were your best subjects? Is there a pattern there? What kinds of 
        extracurricular activities did you participate in while in high school? What kinds of things did you 
        learn from part-time or summer jobs? &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        The <strong>third</strong> stop on your journey involves examining what you value in work. Examples of values include: 
        helping society, working under pressure, group affiliation, stability, security, status, pacing, working 
        alone or with groups, having a positive impact on others, and many others. Again, a visit to your college's 
        career center should help.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        The <strong>fourth</strong> stop on your journey is career exploration. There are many schools that offer "what can I do 
        with a major in…?" fact sheets or Websites. You can also learn more about various occupations, including 
        future trends, by searching the US Department of Labor’s <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri"><a href="http://www.bls.gov/OCO/"
                                target="_blank">Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-2009 Edition</a></span>. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        The <strong>fifth</strong> stop on your journey is the reality check. You need to honestly evaluate your options. Do you 
        really value physicians and have an interest in being a doctor, but have little skills in science? Does 
        your occupation require an advanced degree, but your future commitments preclude graduate study? Do you 
        have a strong interest in the arts, but your family is convinced you will become a CPA like your father? 
        There are often ways to get around some of the obstacles during the reality check, but it is still important 
        to face these obstacles and be realistic about whether you can get around them. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>
        The <strong>sixth</strong> and final stop on your journey is the task of narrowing your choices and focusing on choosing 
        a major. Based on all your research and self-assessment of the first five stops on your journey, you 
        should now have a better idea of the careers/majors you are not interested in pursuing as well as a 
        handful of potential careers/majors that do interest you. What are the typical majors found at a 
        comprehensive university?&nbsp;</li>

        What are some other resources for helping you get more information about a major and/or a career? 
        <br />
        <br />
        Take advantage of:
        <ul>
        <li>Your college's <strong>course catalog</strong> -– you'll be amazed at the wealth of information you can find 
        here…from required courses to specialized majors and tracks.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>professors</strong>, including your academic adviser -– talk with your professors, whether 
        you have taken a class with them or not…many of them have worked in the field in which they 
        teach and all are experts about careers and career opportunities. </li>
        <li>Your <strong>classmates</strong>, especially upperclassmen -– these are the folk who are deep into their 
        major, perhaps already having had an internship or gone through job interviews...use them as a 
        resource to gather more information. </li>
        <li>Your <strong>college's alumni</strong> -– unless your college was just founded, your school probably 
        has a deep and varied group of alums, many of whom like to talk with current students…so use 
        them as a resource to gather more information about careers.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>family and friends</strong> -– there's a wealth of information right at your fingertips. 
        Next time you go home or call home, ask your family about majors and careers.  </li> 
        <li>Your <strong>college's career center</strong> -– almost always under-appreciated, these folk have such 
        a wealth of information at their fingertips that it is a shame more students don't take 
        advantage of them…and not just in your senior year –- start visiting in your first year 
        because most have resources for choosing a major and a career, as well as internship and 
        job placement information.</li>
        </ul>
        There are also numerous books on the topic available at your local library.
