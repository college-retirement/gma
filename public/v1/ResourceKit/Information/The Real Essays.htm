            If the application asks you to select <i>one</i> activity, achievement, or experience and discuss what it means to you, the question requires a response, whether short or long, that is not simply factual--it requires choice.  These are the tough ones.  They come in three varieties:<br><br>
            <b>The "You" Question</b><br>
            Most of these boil down to "tell us about yourself."  Some examples:<br>
            <ul>1.  A personal statement
           <li>"Please complete a one-page personal statement and submit it with your application." (James Madison University)</li>
           <li>"Write an essay which conveys to the reader a sense of who you are." (Columbia University)</li>
           <li>"Please write a personal essay, telling the Admission Committeee more about yourself.  This essay...is your opportunity to speak in your own voice about something that matters to you.  The choice of topic is entirely up to you." (Syracus University)</li>
     </ul>
     <ul>2.  Describe a significant experience, interest, challenge or value.
     <li>"Tell us about one of the best conversations you've ever had." (Pfizer College)</li>
     <li>"Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has special meaning to you." (Common Application)</li>
     <li>"Describe any interesting experience you have had during your college admissions search." (Juniata College)</li>
     <li>"Creative people state that taking risks often promotes important discoveries in their lives or their work.  Discuss a risk that has led to a significant change (positive or negative) in your personal or intellectual life." (Simmons College)</li>
     <li>"Describe the most challenging obstacle you have had to overcome; discuss its impact, and tell what you have learned from the experience." (Guilford College)</li></ul>
<ul>3.  How have you grown and developed?
<li>"To learn to think is to learn to question.  Discuss a matter you once thought you knew "for sure," that you have since learned to question." (Bryn Mawr College)</li>
<li>"How would you describe yourself as a human being?  What quality do you like best in yourself and what do you like least?  What quality would you most like to see flourish and which would you like to see whither?"  (Bates College)</li></ul>   
<b>The "Why Us?" Question       
</b>     <br>
These questions focus on your choice of school or career as self-reflective.  Some examples:
<ul>4.  Why have you selected College X?
<li>"Why is UVM a good college choice for you?" (University of Vermont)</li>
<li>"Tell us about yourself, your reasons for applying to USF, and your reasons for seeking a college education."  (University of San Francisco)</li>
<li>"Describe your reasons for selecting Loyola College and your personal and professional goals and plans for after college." (Loyola College MD)</li></ul>
<ul>5.  Why have you chosen this program or profession?
<li>"Please tell us about your career goals and any plans you may have for graduate study." (Westfield State College)</li>
<li>We would like to know...what experiences have led you to select your professional field and objective."  (Boston University)</li>
<li>Please relate your interest in studying at Georgetown University to your future goals."  (Georgetown University)</li></ul> 
<b>The Creative Question      
</b>        <br>
<ul>6.  The issue question
<li>"Do you believe there is a generation gap?  Describe the differences between your generation and others."  (Denison College)</li>
<li>"Discuss some issue of personal, local, national, or international concern and its importance to you."  (Common Application)</li>
<li>"In your opinion, what is the greatest challenge that your generation will face?  What ideas do you have for dealing with this issue?"  (College of the Holy Cross)</li>
<li>"What is the value and importance of community service in our society and tell us what it means to you." (Ohio Wesleyan University)</li></ul>
<ul>7.  The hero or influential person question
<li>"Who do you feel has served as the strongest Afro-American role model in this century and why?"  (Spelman College)</li>
<li>"Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence." (Common Application)</li></ul>
<ul>8.  The book question.
<li>"Choose a significant book, piece of writing, or research article that you have read in the past year.  Explain the author's thesis and discuss how she or he proves or argues that thesis.  Explain why you think the work is significant." (Earlham College)</li>
<li>"Discuss some creative work that could serve as a key to the way you see the world and the way you see yourself in the world.  The creative work may be a scientific theory, a novel, film, poem, song or any other art form." (University of Chicago)</li></ul>  
<ul>9.  A quotation to comment on
<li>"John Keats said, 'Even a proverb is no proverb to you till your Life has illustrated it.'  Please tell us about an experience in your own life which illustrated a proverb, maxim or quote that has special meaning for you." (Duke University)</li>
<li>"'Lying is done with words and also with silence.' -- Adrienne Rich" (Connecticut College)</li></ul>  
<ul>10.  Imagining the future
<li>"How can I prepare educationally for the 21st century?" (Hampton College)</li>
<li>"You have just completed your 300-page autobiography.  Please submit page 217." (University of Pennsylvania)</li>
<li>"For some prognosticators the end of the world was in sight by the year 1000.  How do you forsee your world of 2020." (Dickinson College) </li></ul>
<ul>11.  An academic essay or school paper.
<li>"In lieu of an essay, Lehigh requires each applicant to submit a graded writing sample of reasonable length in any subject..." (Lehigh University)</li>
<li>"Please submit a copy of a graded writing sample which you believe will assist us in evaluation your application."  (Trinity College DC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>12.  Others
<li>"Ask and answer the one important question which you wish we had asked." (Carleton College)</li>
<li>"Reflect on the relationship between passion and compassion."  (Bennington College)</li>
<li>"What is the biggest misconception people have of you and why?" (Hiram College)</li>
<li>"If you were given the money to start your own business, what business would you choose and why?" (Bentley College)</li>
<li>"Write your own recommendation for admission..." (Hobart and William Smith Colleges)</li>
<li>"What else do we need to know?" (Unity College)</li></ul>
<br>
Underlying all these questions is choice.  The question may be direct and ask you to choose something about yourself to discuss, or it may be indirect and require you to write about something either relevant or tangential to the admissions process.  Some schoools ask you to explain why you chose them or why you chose college at all.  Others like a less relevant go-between: choose an event, person, book, quotation, woman of the year, photograph, or invention.  you may have to choose a topic; you will certainly have to choose and limit what you include in your response.<br>
<br>
Why is the process of choice a significant source of information about the applicant?  Why do so many college believe they will learn about you--and some think they can learn the most about you--by observing the choices you make?  (Note that interviewers employ this technique, too:  "If you were a color, what color would you be?" "Whom do you admire most?")  First, choosing shows <i>preferences</i>.  Personality assessments and tests like the Myers Briggs Type Indicator use preferences to draw conclusions about character, personality, and counseling.  Are you an arts person or a hard-facts science type?  Certainly there is a difference between the person who would like to talk to Machiavelli about the cold war and someone who would share a tuna-fish sandwich with Isolde to find out what it's like to be the object of a great and doomed passion.  The choice would be revealing.
<br><br>
Second, choice also reflects <i>values</i>.  The person who drives a tomato red 1971 Volkswagon until rust leaves nothing for the floorboards to cling to is making a statement about how he wants to spend his money and what he cares about.  We say, "That dress isn't me" or "I'm not a cat person."  In choosing, you indicate what matters to you and how you percieve yourself.
<br><br>
Third, choosing shows <i>how</i> you think.  Are you whimsical, a person who chooses on impulse?  Or are you methodical, careful, a person who gathers background information before chooosing?  Questions about you and about career and college reflect these choosing patterns, and even a question about a national issue can show your particular <i>thinking style, level of intelligence, and insight</i>.  The process, too, is under scutiny here--how carefully the question has been considered, how extensive is your knowledge, how seriously you regarded the hoice.
<br><br>
Do you analyze and think about things that happen to you?  Do you feel most comfortable discussing recognized issues, writing about AIDS, South Africa, war in the Middle East?  Are you a risk taker, writing an essay that makes a case for itself out of missing socks, lunch with A.A. Milne, the heroic qualities of Jim Henson?  Do you respond with a direct answer or go wordy and pompous: "One concept that I've been concerned with recently is reality."
<br><br>
The college regards your choices  as a way to evaluate your preferences, values, mental processes, creativity, sense of humor, and depth of knowledge.  The writing itself reflects your power of persuasion, organizational abilities, style, and mastery of standard written English.  You can see why so many colleges want an essay and why admissions personnel read folder after folder.  Ten aspects in 500 words!  The essay is worth your serious attention.  Give it all you've got.  IT MATTERS!
