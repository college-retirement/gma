            So, it’s about that time of year where your parents are on your back to make those campus visits. They may seem like a drag now, but when it helps you make the right choice, you’ll be happy.  The college you select is such an important decision that it warrants those excessively expensive visits to make sure you choose a college that is right for you.  Make sure you check out these places on your visit.

<b>10.  Quad / Hangout Hotspots
</b><br />
Since you can’t make friends playing World of Warcraft in your dorm room all day, you’ll find yourself out on the quad (or a comparable hangout spot) quite often.  Your school should have a nice lawn to read on and an open area to play football or frisbee. If this doesn’t exist, or if it does and there’s nobody there, this might be a school you want to rethink; you’ll be surprised how important little things like playing catch with your buddies in between classes will factor into your enjoyment of school.
<br /><br />
 

<b>9.  Dorms
</b><br />
When you’re not in the classroom or grabbing a bite in the cafeteria, there is a pretty good chance you’ll be hanging out in your dorm room. While you’re visiting the campus, ask to see the freshman dorms, but ask to see the upperclassmen dorms as well.  Freshman dorms will almost never be great, but make sure that you’ll be moving on up as you progress in class years. You don’t want to be living in a shack for four years…just one is okay.
<br /><br />
 

<b>8.  Dining Halls
</b><br />
The dining hall is the simplest and most efficient way to eat on campus, and with all the studying we know you’ll be doing, you generally won’t have time to prepare yourself a nice lunch or dinner.  The average student will eat at the cafeteria twice a day; it’s possible you go a bit less, but it’s likely you go even more than that, whether for a snack or late-night meal.  Be certain that the cafeterias are large, clean, provide a variety of quality food, and are readily accessible.  If the campus is big, chances are the school will have multiple dining halls; make sure you see them all.
<br /><br />
 

<b>7.  Classrooms</b>
<br />
If you think you can ace exams without ever going to class, think again. Not only do you need to go to class once in a while to make sure you’re up to speed with what’s going on with exams and homework, but a lot of smaller classes also base some of their grades on participation. Granted, you can miss class once in a while, but don’t forget that attendance is often mandatory.  Make sure that you like the classroom setting of the school you’re visiting. Are they big or small? Are they flat or stadium-style? Is the technology adequate, or better yet, very advanced? Will you be a nameless face or someone your teacher will be able to interact with?

 <br /><br />

<b>6.  Interview</b>
<br />
While you’re on your campus visit, why not put a face to your application? Make an appointment to meet with an admission counselor so that they can get to know you as more than a list of test scores and activities.  This is your chance to show your personality, and you can even use the time to ask any questions that you might still have about the school. Just be sure that you’re friendly, polite, and articulate because the first impression is a lasting one.

 <br /><br />

<b>5.  Health Center
</b><br />
If you’re lucky, you won’t spend much time in the Health Center at your college.  However, should you get sick or injured and are in need of anything from emergency care to DayQuil, it’s always reassuring to know you have access to top-quality medical care and technology.

 <br /><br />

<b>4.  Gym / On-Campus Athletic Facilities
</b><br />
The college I attended built a brand new Fitness Center on campus that opened the first week of my senior year.  I spent more time in the gym that year than during my first three years of college combined.  Point being, a nice gym makes you want to work out.  So if you’re interested in getting into or staying in shape, make sure your college has a state-of-the-art gym.  If you’re into college athletics, the school’s on-campus facilities are also something you should check out.  The games on campus can be a pretty big draw, and even if you’re not a huge sports fan they double as a popular social event.

 <br /><br />

<b>3.  Chair of the Department of Your Potential Major(s)
</b><br />
If you have any inkling whatsoever about what your major in college might be, you should certainly make an appointment to meet briefly with the Department Chair during your college visit.  They’ll be thrilled to meet a potential major, because more students equals more money for their department, and you’ll get some valuable insight into the courses you’d take, professors you’d study under, and academic opportunities that your school and potential major will offer.  Don’t hesitate to schedule several of these meetings, especially if you’re unsure about your potential major.

 <br /><br />

<b>2.  Bookstore
</b><br />
If you are the first child in your family to attend college, you should prepare to dissociate yourself from your parents upon entering the bookstore.  As soon as mom or dad spies a price tag on a textbook, they may react with surprise, anger, disbelief, tears, or any combination of the above.   After they’ve calmed down, reassure them that you already set up accounts on Amazon and Half.com, and convince them that your prudence and frugality should earn you one of those nice college hoodies from the bookstore.  Just don’t show them the receipt.

 <br /><br />

<b>1.  Talk to Students
</b><br />
This is the most important part of a college visit, and an opportunity that too many college-bound students do not take advantage of.  If you visit colleges while school is in session, you should make it a point to approach a few students - at the cafeteria, the library, or just while walking around campus - and ask them any questions you have or even just about their general experience at the school.  You’ll get much more honest answers than you will from tour guides, and most students will be more than happy to stop and chat for a few minutes.
