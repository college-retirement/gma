            After a long school year filled with hard work and little sleep, the urge of any student may be to take it easy. But keeping busy over the summer can prove to be beneficial not only by improving your overall breadth of life experiences, but also by boosting your application in the minds of college or graduate-school admissions officers. Consider these four options for summer: internships, academic programs, study-abroad programs, and volunteering. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Internships 
</b>
<br />
<br />With the current downswing in the job market, internships have become a key element of the competitive student's resume. These work experiences bring a real-world perspective to a course of study while also empowering students with practical job skills. Furthermore, the mentors and networking contacts acquired over an internship are invaluable resources when looking for that first career opportunity.
<br />
<br />
There are plenty of options for structuring an internship. It might be full-time or part-time, paid or unpaid--it might even offer course credit. No matter the permutation, an internship can provide a leg up on job hunting or winning admission to graduate or professional school. 
<br />
<br />
Before applying to or accepting any position, you should know the internship's responsibilities thoroughly. While most internships include some degree of grunt-work (filing, answering phones, etc.), many companies go to great lengths to ensure their interns gain a good understanding of the business by conducting seminars, arranging participation in industry events, and assigning special intern-managed projects. Establish your goals for your internship experience beforehand and choose the opportunity that best enhances your knowledge of a particular business while helping you build the skills you'll need to distinguish yourself in a the job market.
<br />
<br />
<b>Summer academic programs
</b>
<br />
Although the thought of extending school through the summer months may not appeal to many individuals, it can be a great source of enrichment. Summer academic programs offer a host of benefits for students who are willing to make the sacrifice. While summer programs at four-year colleges can be quite expensive, students also have the option to take coursework at community colleges where costs might be a bit less prohibitive.

<br />
<br />
Summer academic programs provide students the opportunity to study a particular field in more depth than during the regular school year, and also to get introduced to subjects that are not available in many schools. Trying out a particular field of interest without making a long-term commitment can help shape a student's career choices. Finally, academic programs strengthen college and graduate-school admissions applications by showing a student's passion for and commitment to a subject. 
<br />
<br />
Thoroughly evaluate the academic, social, and intellectual environment before applying to any academic program. While attending a summer program at a large and prestigious university may look impressive on your transcript, a smaller, more intimate setting at another college or university may give you the hands-on environment you need to thrive in a particular specialty. 
<br />
<br />
<b>Summer study-abroad and travel programs
</b>
<br />The education you can gain in a study-abroad program reaches far beyond the confines of a classroom or a course of study. Study-abroad programs can give you an acute awareness of your role in a global community. Master a foreign language, conduct historical research, or volunteer in a hospital, while taking in the wonders of the world and immersing yourself in new cultures--all for college credit. Knowledge and appreciation of the world's unique societies not only enhances your perspective on a number of issues, but also provides rich material for admissions essays.
<br />
<br />
With so many varieties of summer study abroad available, it is key that you determine which type of program best fits your goals and your personality. Some students prefer a more academic and structured university setting that groups them together with other visiting students. Other individuals thrive in a looser environment that allows them to interact more freely with the local population and learn independently. Is academic study your primary goal, or are you looking to participate in an foreign adventure? These are issues that must be worked out before you embark on your trip.
<br />
<br />
Despite the many educational and social benefits, the one major drawback to summer-abroad programs is the cost. With some programs costing as much as $7,500 for the summer, students can be discouraged from even pursuing these opportunities. However, financial aid and scholarships--as well as grants and fellowships--are available for most programs. Weigh the overall benefits of any study-abroad opportunity against the potential costs. An experience of a lifetime may be well worth a temporary financial inconvenience. 

<br />
<br />
<b>Volunteering</b>
<br />
Community service projects allow students to use practical skills to address social, economic, and/or environmental needs of society. You might consider volunteering as an opportunity to engage in cultural exchange, to protect the environment, to work for social justice, or to practice the principles of your religion. Think about the kind of summer experience you're seeking and the way you want to incorporate volunteer efforts into your daily life; this will help you select the best program for your needs and interests.
<br />
<br />
Volunteering in a community service program can be invaluable in developing leadership skills. When complemented by the cultural interaction with community residents and the personal satisfaction of completing a difficult and meaningful project, you'll have much to talk about when applying to college or grad school.
<br />
<br />
<b>Research your options
</b>
<br />
These are only a few of options available to you this summer. Do your research and find the option that fits your priorities. Whatever you choose to do over your summer vacation, remember that this break is a unique opportunity for you to pursue your passions. Don't try to second-guess what college recruiters may want to see when making your decision. Instead, plan your summer according to what will enhance your experience as a student and as a human being. Colleges don't look for candidates who fit a particular academic or social mold, but who will bring something exceptional and enriching to their campuses. Find out what sets you apart from others. Any summer initiative in which you participate should develop that quality to the fullest. Good luck and have a fun and rewarding summer!
