                This CD is intended to get you organized and to supply you with everything you need
                to make your experience with College &amp; Retirement Solutions as productive as
                possible. To that end, we've created this document as a primer on how to use the
                disc itself. Listed below are two distinct sections: The first is where you access
                the reporting documents that College &amp; Retirement Solutions needs from you to
                assist you, and the instructions for you to follow for the things that only you
                can do (i.e. Obtain electronic signatures (PINs)).
                The second section is informational
                and is intended to provide you with the needed insight to make this a successful
                journey for you and your family.<br />

                            Your PIN is your electronic signature. It's needed to electronically sign your FAFSA.
                                Without a PIN, you will not be able to file and receive
                            financial aid. To get your PINs (one for both the parent and the student), follow
                            the directions below.<br /><br />
                            <strong>How to do this:</strong><br /><br />

                                    and apply for a PIN numbers.<br /><br />

                                        <li>You will need a PIN for both the student and at least one parent or guardian.<br /><br /></li>
                                        <li>During the process, you'll need to choose a challenge question. The challenge question
                                            can be used to retrieve your PIN at a later date in case you forget it. You'll be
                                            able to choose the question from a list, then type in your answer. Please note that
                                            the answer is CASE SENSITIVE.<br /><br />
