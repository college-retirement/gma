<b>Study Tips for Tactile Learners</b>
<ul>
	<li>Sit near the front of the room and take notes throughout the class period.  Don't worry about correct spelling or writing in complete sentences.  Jot down key words and draw pictures or make charts to help you remember the information you are hearing.</li>
	<li>When studying, walk back and forth with textbook, notes, or flashcards in hand and read the information out loud.</li>
	<li>Think of ways to make your learning tangible, i.e. something you can put your hands on.  For example, make a model that illustrates a key concept.  Spend extra time in a lab setting to learn an important procedure.  Spend time in the field (e.g. a museum, historical site, or job site) to gain first-hand experience of your subject matter.</li>
	<li>To learn a sequence of steps, make 3 x 5 flashcards for each step.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Arrange the cards on a table top to represent the correct sequence.</li>
			<li>Put words, symbols, or pictures on your flashcards – anything that helps you remember the information.</li>
			<li>Use highlighter pens in contrasting colors to emphasize important points.</li>
			<li>Limit the amount of information per card to aid recall.</li>
			<li>Practice putting the cards in order until the sequence becomes automatic.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>When reviewing new information, copy key points onto a chalkboard, easel board, or other large writing surface.</li>
	<li>Learn and practice new material by relying on your sense of touch.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Copy and paraphrase notes.</li>
			<li>Use your computer as much as possible.</li>
			<li>Trace words with your finger or the eraser end of a pencil.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Take frequent study breaks and vary your activities or study in short blocks.</li>
	<li>Make studying more physical – work at a standing desk, chew gum, pace while memorizing, read while on an exercise bike, mold a piece of clay, squeeze a tennis ball</li>
	<li>Use bright colors to highlight reading material</li>
	<li>Dress up your work space with posters and color</li>
	<li>Play music in the background while you study</li>
	<li>When reading, first skim through the whole thing to get a feel for what its about, then read the chapter carefully</li>
</ul>
